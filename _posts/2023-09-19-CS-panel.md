# CS Panel Takeaways
As my time for college applications nears and my sister's recent departure o college as a Computer Science major, I have been spending a lot of time thinking about what major I should pursue. More specifically, I've been looking into computer science, data science, and statistics. This panel has given me some clarity and considerable information on my decision of what path to take. 

### Diverse Academic Options
One takeaway from this panel was the diverse academic options in other fields other than Computer Science. Previously, I didn't know that specialized fields like Computer Science and Engineering are densely packed with technical coursework. Other fields, Mabel said, such as Cognitive Science, have a wide range of classes offered within the field. I think this is a really important matter to consider, because this flexibility would allow me to fit my education with different interests and apply my Computer Science knowledge to it rather than just focus on that one field. Or, even if I do decide to go down the path of Computer Science, I should consider saving space for a minor to have other topics to expand my knowledge and apply my existing knowledge to.
